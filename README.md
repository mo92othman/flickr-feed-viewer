# Flickr Feed Viewer

## Overview

This project implements a simple Flicker feed images application with a search functionality using NEXT.js for the client-side and a Express.js for the backend server (currently the express server is not working, and used NEXT api router instead) to fetch images based on search queries.

## Features

- **Search Bar**: Allows users to enter search queries and navigate to specific search results.
- **Image Gallery**: Displays images fetched from an Flicker API based on the search query.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless user experience across different devices.
